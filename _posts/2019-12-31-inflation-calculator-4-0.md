**Inflation Calculator 4.0** is [now available](https://apps.apple.com/app/inflation-calculator/id926713392) on the App Store. Along with data for 2020, this update adds support for 13 new languages including Spanish, French, Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, and more!

Inflation Calculator was originally released in 2014 for the US Dollar. I added support for 21 more international currencies back in 2017, but the app was still only available in English. It hasn't taken off internationally (over 90% of downloads have been in English-speaking countries) but hopefully this update will help turn it around. Inflation Calculator now supports the local currency *and the native language* of ***billions*** more users around the world. Only time will tell if the work pays off ü§ûüèª
