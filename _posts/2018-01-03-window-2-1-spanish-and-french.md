Window has been on the App Store for around a year and a half, but until now its only been available in English. After gaining valuable experience from translating [Blurb](/blog/blurb-2-0-update) into Spanish and Chinese, I decided it was a good time to give Window the same treatment. With some hard work and outside help, Window is now available for download in English, Spanish, and French!

It takes a good bit of effort to set up an app to be translated into other languages. Every piece of text that ends up on screen has to be piped through a tool that looks up the appropriate translation. It's also to important to take regional preferences into account, like 24-hour time, weeks that start on Monday instead of Sunday, and less-common weight units like the English stone. Small details like this really improved the app for international audiences.

I polled Facebook to decide which languages to support in this newest update. There was a clear consensus on Spanish, a handful of requests for French, and a scattering of other languages like German, Russian, Finish, and Polish. I wanted to choose two languages to start with, so I went with Spanish and French for now. I used the OneSky platform to professionally translate the the app into Spanish, and one of my friends who is fluent in French was kind enough to contribute translations as well.

<h4>Downloading Window</h4>

It's exciting to open up the app to even more users from even more countries! If you haven't downloaded Window, you can get it on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/window-intermittent-fasting-tracker/id1112765909?mt=8) for iPhone and iPad.
