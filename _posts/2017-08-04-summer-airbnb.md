This summer I had the pleasure of interning at Airbnb in San Francisco, California. This was a big move -- I had been out west twice, but up until this summer I had never been outside of Georgia for more than a week straight. Needless to say, it was the best summer of my life! I really loved it here at Airbnb. It has a great culture and a was the perfect environment to continue to learn and grow as an iOS Engineer.

I worked on the Booking team this summer. They're all about improving the core Airbnb product -- booking homes for your travels. We want to make this process as easy as possible and foster the strong sense of trust that ties our community together. This takes lots of forms, including improving the guest booking experience, increasing host adoption of Instant Book, and giving our hosts the tools they need to succeed. This touches many pieces of our product, so I got the opportunity to work on three very different projects.
