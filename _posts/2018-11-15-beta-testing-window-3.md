I've been working hard on a huge update to Window over the past seven months, and it's finally almost done! Today I'm starting the **Window 3.0 Public Beta** in preparation for an official release next month. There are tons of new features in this new update, from new features to entirely new ways to use Window.

<!--break-->

<h4>New Screens</h4>

{% include photoswipe.html images=page.dashboard max-height=475 %}

The old Setup screen has been given a complete redesign. Now, when you open Window you'll see a Dashboard with all of the most important information about your eating window or fast. You can open a new eating window or schedule one one for later, jot down notes about your day, and see info about the past few days at a glance.

{% include photoswipe.html images=page.timeline max-height=475 %}

The Timeline screen is the newest way to look at your past eating windows and fasts. They're integrated in a single chronological timeline so you can see them in the same order you recorded them. You can also see all of your notes in one place for the first time.

<h4>New Features</h4>

{% include photoswipe.html images=page.custom-schedule max-height=475 %}

Since I published Window in 2016, the most common feature requests were all related to making *Window Scheduling* more customizable and powerful. In this update, I completely reworked the internals of how eating windows are scheduled to open the door for much more customizable schedules. Now, you can set up a Custom Weekly Schedule with different eating windows for each day of the week. 

{% include photoswipe.html images=page.onboarding max-height=475 %}

As Window gains great new features, it still needs to be approachable for new users. *Onboarding* is the process of guiding new users through how to use an app. Up until now Window didn't really have much onboarding to speak of. This update brings huge improvements to the onboarding flow, featuring lively illustrations and thoughtful advice on how to get the most out of Window. There's also new messages for existing users, like a *congratulations* when they record their 100th eating window!

<h4>New Devices</h4>

{% include photoswipe.html images=page.applewatch max-height=475 %}

You can now use Window on Apple Watch! The new Watch app lets you manage your eating window from your wrist. You can open or schedule an eating window and keep tabs on it without ever touching your phone. The Watch app also includes a [complication](https://www.imore.com/how-add-third-party-complications-your-apple-watch) that you can add to your watch face, so you can see your current windor or fast any time throughout the day with just a glance.

{% include photoswipe.html images=page.ipad max-height=475 %}

This update includes major improvements to the iPad app. Window has supported iPad since last year, but that support was a little [half baked](/blog/announcing-window-2-0#ipad) (it was mostly the same as the iPhone app, but bigger). Like a real pro app, Window uses a split view to show you two screens at once. The dashboard is always on the left, and you can switch between the Calendar, Timeline, and Weight screens on the right. (Oh, did I mention that the iPad app also supports Weight Tracking now?)

<h4>New System Integrations</h4>

{% include photoswipe.html images=page.siri max-height=475 %}

You can now use Window with Siri! You can add phrases like *"Hey siri, open my window"* or *"Hey Siri, how's my window going?"*. If you set up the phrases on your phone, you can also use them on your Apple Watch or even your HomePod.

{% include photoswipe.html images=page.today max-height=475 %}

You can also use Window without even unlocking your phone! Window has a new lock screen [widget](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207122) that can tell your current eating window or fast.

<h4><a name="testing">How to Test</a></h4>

The Window 3.0 Public Beta is available via [TestFlight](https://t.co/1uTPl6KFu7).  This is a **Beta** release, so there may be bugs or other issues with the app at this time. An official public release will be available next month.

<a class="button" style="margin-top: -10px;" href="https://t.co/1uTPl6KFu7">Start Testing</a>

<h4><a name="testing">Instructions</a></h4>

 - Install the **[TestFlight app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8)** on your iPhone or iPad.
 - Open the Test Flight invitation link on your device: **[https://t.co/1uTPl6KFu7](https://t.co/1uTPl6KFu7)**
 - Tap the "Start Testing" button. 
 - In TestFlight, tap the "Accept" button.
 - Tap "Install".
 - TestFlight may show you an alert that says *"Do you want to replace the current app version with the test version? You may lose the app's data"*. Dont worry! I've tested this, and upgrading from an old version of Window to the Public Beta of Window 3.0 **will not** make you lose all of your data. Confirm that you'd like to install the Window beta.
