**AR Planes** is now available to [download](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ar-planes-flight-tracker/id1292681350?mt=8&at=1000lMfm) on the App Store! It lets you discover nearby planes in augmented reality -- just point your camera to see all the planes around you. I've been working on it for a long time, so I'm really excited to finally put it out there!

 - See planes from anywhere in the world by moving your AR viewpoint to a different place on the map
 - Save a collection of interesting flights that you come across

<h4>Making AR Planes</h4>

AR Planes started at [Hack the North 2017](/blog/recap-hack-the-north-2017) in Waterloo, Ontario. I worked with my friends [Mantas](https://mantasmatelis.com/), who I met while I was working at Airbnb last summer, and [Olivia](https://github.com/oliviabrown9), who we met at the hackathon. At the event, we had 36 hours to build anything we wanted. After tossing around ideas for most of the first night, we settled on making what would become AR Planes. The [original prototype](https://youtu.be/dnYHQ-7wlag) wasn't much, but it was enough for us to be chosen as one of the ten winning projects (out of over 200 teams)! It's grown a lot since then, and now I think it can finally stand on its own as a fully-featured app.
