Big news! Earlier this summer, [Window](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/window-intermittent-fasting/id1112765909) was acquired by a large health-and-wellness-focused [mobile development firm](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/dailyburn/id322120289). They'll be managing and improving the app going forward, and I won't be involved in the project anymore.

This transiton came at a great time in my personal life. I devoted a huge portion of 2018 towards creating [Window 3.0](/blog/announcing-window-3) (that update was over 8 months in the making!). I'm starting a full time iOS engineering position at [Airbnb](/blog/my-summer-at-airbnb) on July 22, so I would have have much less time available to work on supporting and improving Window. Instead, Window will be in great hands. I'm looking forward to seeing where they take the project!
