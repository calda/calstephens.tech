# Blur Privacy Policy

Protecting your private information is a paramount priority for us. This Statement of Privacy applies to the *Blur* app and governs data collection and usage. *Blur* is a utility app designed to let users customize their photos with a blurry background. By using the *Blur* app, you, “the user”, consent to the data practices described in this statement.

## Collection of your Personal Information
*Blur* does not collect any personal information about the user.

## Anonymous Data Collection
*Blur* collects and transmits some anonymous data related to critical functions of the application. *Blur* uses the *Crashlytics* service to transmit anonymous crash reports. *Blur* also uses the *Answers* service to collect and transmit minimal information related to your usage of the app. Specifically, *Blur* uses *Answers* to track user sessions (how many times the app is used, and for how long). *Blur* doesn’t transmit any information about how you use the app (for example, what features you use).

*Crashlytics* and *Answers* are services provided by *Google, Inc.*, and the associated data is thus protected according to the *[Google Privacy Policy]((https://policies.google.com/privacy))*.

## Changes to this Statement
This Statement of Privacy may be updated occasionally to reflect product evolution and feedback. We encourage you to periodically review this Statement of Privacy to be aware how your information is being used and protected.

## Contact Information
We welcome your questions and comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that *Blur* has not adhered to this Statement, please contact the developer at [calstephens.tech](https://calstephens.tech/contact/).

Effective as of December 8, 2018.
