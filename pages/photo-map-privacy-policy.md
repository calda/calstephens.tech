# Photo Map Privacy Policy

Protecting your private information is a paramount priority for us. This Statement of Privacy applies to the *Photo Map* app and governs data collection and usage. *Photo Map* is a utility app that utilizes the user's on-device Photo Library to automatically generate images of the States, Countires, Provinces, and Territories (collectivelly "Places") that the user has visited. By using the *Photo Map* app, you, “the user”, consent to the data practices described in this statement.

## Collection of your Personal Information
*Photo Map* automatically collects some personal information. When you open Photo Map, the app initiates a scan of the Location Metadata of each Photo in the your Photo Library. If the Metadata indicates that the Photo was originally captured in a place (Some country, US state, or other region) that doesn't currently have an associated Photo, the new Photo is imported into the Photo Map app. The imported Photos are stored privately inside the Photo Map app, and never shared or uploaded to the internet. If you delete Photo Map from your device, all references to your personal information and data are deleted as well.

## Anonymous Data Collection
*Photo Map* collects and transmits some anonymous data related to critical functions of the application. *Photo Map* uses the *App Center* service to transmit anonymous crash reports, and to collect and transmit minimal information related to your usage of the app. Photo Map only used App Center to track general usage sessions (how many times the app is used, and for how long). *Photo Map* doesn’t transmit any information about how you use the app (for example, what features you use, or what Places you have visited).

*App Center* is a service provided by *Microsoft Corportation*, and the associated data is thus protected according to the *[Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)*.

## Changes to this Statement
This Statement of Privacy may be updated occasionally to reflect product evolution and feedback. We encourage you to periodically review this Statement of Privacy to be aware how your information is being used and protected.

## Contact Information
We welcome your questions and comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that *Photo Map* has not adhered to this Statement, please contact the developer at [calstephens.tech](https://calstephens.tech/contact/).

Effective as of August 20, 2019.
