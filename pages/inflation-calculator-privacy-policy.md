# Inflation Calculator Privacy Policy

Protecting your private information is a paramount priority for us. This Statement of Privacy applies to the *Inflation Calculator* app and governs data collection and usage. *Inflation Calculator* is a utility app designed to display historical inflation data for the US Dollar, Euro, and 20 other international currencies. By using the *Inflation Calculator* app, you, “the user”, consent to the data practices described in this statement.

## Collection of your Personal Information
*Inflation Calculator* does not collect any personal information about the user.

## Anonymous Data Collection
*Inflation Calculator* collects and transmits some anonymous data related to critical functions of the application. *Inflation Calculator* uses the *Crashlytics* service to transmit anonymous crash reports. *Inflation Calculator* also uses the *Answers* service to collect and transmit minimal information related to your usage of the app. Specifically, *Inflation Calculator* uses *Answers* to track user sessions (how many times the app is used, and for how long). *Inflation Calculator* doesn’t transmit any information about how you use the app (for example, what features you use).

*Crashlytics* and *Answers* are services provided by *Google, Inc.*, and the associated data is thus protected according to the *[Google Privacy Policy]((https://policies.google.com/privacy))*.

## Changes to this Statement
This Statement of Privacy may be updated occasionally to reflect product evolution and feedback. We encourage you to periodically review this Statement of Privacy to be aware how your information is being used and protected.

## Contact Information
We welcome your questions and comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that *Inflation Calculator* has not adhered to this Statement, please contact the developer at [calstephens.tech](https://calstephens.tech/contact/).

Effective as of December 8, 2018.
