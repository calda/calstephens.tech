# AP Planes Privacy Policy

Protecting your private information is a paramount priority for us. This Statement of Privacy applies to the *AR Planes* app and governs data collection and usage. By using the *AR Planes* app, you, “the user”, consent to the data practices described in this statement.

## Collection of your Personal Information
*AR Planes* automatically collects some personal information. In order to provide Augmented Reality functionality, the app requires access to your device's Camera. *AR Planes* never records the video from your camera, and it is used exclusively to provide an immersive auhmented reality experience. *AR Planes* must also access your location so that it may determine what planes are nearby your current location. *AR Planes* never records your location data, and this data is never transmitted off of your device.

## Anonymous Data Collection
*AR Planes* collects and transmits some anonymous data related to critical functions of the application. *AR Planes* uses the *App Center* service to transmit anonymous crash reports, and to collect and transmit minimal information related to your usage of the app. Specifically, AR Planes uses App Center to track general usage sessions (how many times the app is used, and for how long), as well as anonymous usage data on features within the app (for example, what percentage of users use the "Custom Viewpoint" feature).

*App Center* is a service provided by *Microsoft Corportation*, and the associated data is thus protected according to the *[Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)*.

## Changes to this Statement
This Statement of Privacy may be updated occasionally to reflect product evolution and feedback. We encourage you to periodically review this Statement of Privacy to be aware how your information is being used and protected.

## Contact Information
We welcome your questions and comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that *AR Planes* has not adhered to this Statement, please contact the developer at [calstephens.tech](https://calstephens.tech/contact/).

Effective as of December 1, 2019.
